Hey, I saw how to mod the game and I decided to make a week 7 support with Kade Engine 1.5.1,
the game version I decided to name it 0.2.7.5, cuz, I think it is alike the official 0.2.8 from the Funkin'
Developers, wich you can play on Newgrounds.

------CUSTOM BUILD ERRORS-----
1. PLAYING THE SONGS: 
If you want to play the week 7 on story mode, it probably crash, cuz of the .webm player code. So
play them in the freeplay section.
2. ALTERNATE ANIMATIONS:
In Ugh song, the "ugh" animation it is still a WIP, I'll be fixing it in the upcoming updates.
In Stress, the "Pretty Good" anmation, is the same thing, but, here the animation plays only 5 frames
of the complete animation, it'll be fixed in upcoming updates.
3. PICO IN DA SPEAKER:
Yes, it isn't all complete, this is just a beta version, so, it isn't complete at all, so, the pico in the speaker
animation only plays one of all the animation.
4. BACKGROUND:
The background of the songs are complete about a 80%, cuz, the tankman killed by pico and the 
tankman in the tank left to add them in the background, fixed in upcoming updates.
